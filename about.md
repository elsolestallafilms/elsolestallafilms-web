We specialize on helping people tell their stories, whatever those may be. Our background is in editing, and this is why we are experts at finding the right language to narrate those stories. Our philosophy is that by connecting deeply with the content, the language, the tone, the purpose, and the spirit of the project, we can visualize what the end-product will be, and find audiovisual solutions to achieve it. We know how to deliver a satisfying piece, especially when our clients have problems with material that has already been shot.

We have hundreds of hours of editing experience with very diverse contents, which has given us first-hand experience with a number of narrative technical difficulties, from problems with camera and sound, to issues with character development. 

As an editing collective, we focus our attention on utilizing image and sound to compose an estheatically appealing product without sacrificing the depth of the narrative. 

We do not believe that these services should be prohibitively expensive or only available to high-budget projects. We are especially interested in collaborating with non-profit organizations and individuals who are advancing socially and enviromentally-conscious causes.
